# Neural Network

This is a simple model of a neural network

## Prereqs

Python 3 as well as the Numpy library

to install numpy with pip on the command line use

```
pip install numpy
```

## Getting started

On Github, click on the green button that says "Clone or download", then "Download ZIP".

Extract the zipped/compressed folder and open the resulting folder.

Run xor_nn.py to see an example or create your own code using the xor network as a template

## Testing

Still need to create unit tests
